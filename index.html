        <h1 class="text-center my-4">Bridge Crossing Problem</h1>
        <div class="mb-4">
            <p>The problem: Four children (Andrew, Bianca, Charles and Diane) must cross a narrow bridge in the dark. They must share one torch, and the bridge can only carry two people at a time. Andrew can cross the bridge in one minute, Bianca needs two minutes, Charles needs six minutes and Diana needs nine minutes.</p>
            <p>You have two objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to get all the children safely across the bridge.</li>
                <li>How to complete the crossing in the shortest time possible.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Instructions:</p>
            <p>You must give each instruction using a five character code:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1st character - The initial of the slower child who carries the torch
                    <ul>
                        <li>Andrew = A, Bianca = B, Charles = C, Diane = D.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>2nd character – The initial of the faster child who shares the torch
                    <ul>
                        <li>If one child crosses alone, then use “-“ to show there is no second child</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>3rd & 4th character – “X O” = Cross Over, “X B” = Cross Back</li>
                <li>5th character – the number of minutes required for this crossing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sample instructions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To tell Bianca to cross over the bridge, the instruction is “B- X O 2”</li>
                <li>To tell Andrew and Diane to cross back, the instruction is “D A X B 9”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finally you must report the total time taken. The format is “T O T” followed by two digits for the total time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the total time was 25 minutes, the final report is “T O T 2 5”</li>
            </ul>
